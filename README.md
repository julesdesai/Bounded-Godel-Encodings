# Bounded Gödel Encodings for LLM-Native Information Architecture

## Summary

**The Problem**: Current information systems are designed for humans—file hierarchies, URLs, text search, databases—forcing AI systems to process inefficient human-readable formats.

**The Solution**: Transform knowledge into arithmetic encodings that preserve logical relationships, allowing LLMs to reason through their native strength: mathematical operations rather than symbolic manipulation.

**Current Implementation**: A working system for mathematical theorem libraries (Lean, Coq, Isabelle) that encodes theorems as unique integers whilst preserving dependencies, enabling arithmetic-based reasoning and retrieval.

**The Vision**: This mathematical prototype demonstrates a universal principle applicable to any structured knowledge domain—legal precedents, scientific literature, medical diagnoses, engineering designs—where logical relationships can be preserved as arithmetic operations.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd bounded-godel-encodings
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Parse Mathematical Libraries

```python
from mathematical_library_integration import LibraryIntegrationSystem

# Initialize the integration system
system = LibraryIntegrationSystem()

# Parse a Lean library
lean_theorems = system.integrate_library('lean', Path('/path/to/lean/library'))

# Parse multiple libraries
libraries = [
    {'type': 'lean', 'path': '/path/to/lean'},
    {'type': 'coq', 'path': '/path/to/coq'},
    {'type': 'isabelle', 'path': '/path/to/isabelle'}
]
all_theorems = system.integrate_multiple_libraries(libraries)

# Export unified format
system.export_unified_format(Path('unified_theorems.json'))
```

#### 2. Encode Theorems with Gödel Numbers

```python
from enhanced_bounded_godel_encoding import EnhancedGodelEncoder

# Initialize encoder
encoder = EnhancedGodelEncoder()

# Encode individual theorem
theorem_encoding = encoder.encode_theorem(theorem_object)

# Batch encode for performance
theorem_list = list(all_theorems.values())
encodings = encoder.encode_theorem_batch(theorem_list, parallel=True)

# Validate encoding quality
metrics = encoder.validate_encoding_quality()
print(f"Uniqueness: {metrics.encoding_uniqueness:.1%}")
print(f"Collision rate: {metrics.collision_rate:.1%}")
```

#### 3. Arithmetic-Based Reasoning

```python
# Find theorems by domain (using arithmetic divisibility)
algebra_factor = encoder.mathematical_domains['algebra']
algebra_theorems = [tid for tid, enc in encoder.theorem_encodings.items() 
                   if enc % algebra_factor == 0]

# Find complex theorems (high encodings indicate complexity)
import numpy as np
complex_threshold = np.percentile(list(encoder.theorem_encodings.values()), 80)
complex_theorems = [tid for tid, enc in encoder.theorem_encodings.items() 
                   if enc > complex_threshold]

# Find related theorems through mathematical operations
from math import gcd
def find_related_theorems(target_encoding, threshold=1000):
    return [tid for tid, enc in encoder.theorem_encodings.items()
            if gcd(target_encoding, enc) > threshold]
```

#### 4. Neural Architecture Training

```python
from neural_architecture_evolution import EvolutionaryGodelLLM, EvolutionConfig

# Configure architecture for mathematical reasoning
config = EvolutionConfig(
    d_model=768,
    num_domains=8,          # Mathematical domains
    num_libraries=3,        # Lean, Coq, Isabelle
    max_complexity=10
)

# Initialize model
model = EvolutionaryGodelLLM(config, vocab_size=50000)

# Train on mixed text + encoding data
# (Training loop implementation depends on your framework)
```

#### 5. Comprehensive Evaluation

```python
from evaluation import ComprehensiveEvaluator

# Run full evaluation suite
evaluator = ComprehensiveEvaluator(encoder, model, config)
metrics = evaluator.run_full_evaluation()

# Generate detailed report
report = evaluator.generate_evaluation_report(metrics)
print(f"Overall Score: {report['executive_summary']['overall_score']:.1%}")
print(f"Production Readiness: {report['executive_summary']['production_readiness']}")
```

## Beyond Mathematics: Universal Knowledge Encoding

### The Universal Pattern: Logical Dependencies

The key insight is that **any knowledge domain with logical dependencies can be encoded arithmetically**. Mathematics is our clearest example because dependencies are explicit, but every structured knowledge domain shares the same underlying pattern:

- **Items** (theorems, cases, papers, protocols, strategies)
- **Dependencies** (what each item builds upon)
- **Relationships** (how items connect logically)

### Legal Knowledge Example

**Traditional Legal Research:**
```
Case: Miranda v. Arizona (1966)
Cites: Escobedo v. Illinois (1964), Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)
Principle: Fifth Amendment protection during interrogation
```

**Arithmetic Encoding:**
```python
# Each legal case gets a unique encoding
escobedo_encoding = 1247891
gideon_encoding = 2847632
miranda_encoding = encode_legal_case(
    dependencies=[escobedo_encoding, gideon_encoding],
    legal_domain="criminal_procedure",
    case_type="supreme_court",
    constitutional_amendment=5,
    precedent_strength="binding"
)

# Arithmetic operations reveal legal relationships
def find_related_cases(target_case_encoding):
    return [case_id for case_id, encoding in legal_database.items()
            if gcd(target_case_encoding, encoding) > precedent_threshold]

# Constitutional cases share mathematical properties
fifth_amendment_cases = [case for case, enc in legal_database.items()
                        if enc % FIFTH_AMENDMENT_FACTOR == 0]
```

### Scientific Literature Example

**Traditional Academic Paper:**
```
Paper: "Deep Learning for Protein Folding"
Citations: [AlphaFold paper, Transformer architecture, Protein database]
Domain: Computational Biology
Method: Machine Learning
```

**Arithmetic Encoding:**
```python
alphafold_encoding = 8472691
transformer_encoding = 5839472
protein_db_encoding = 3847261

paper_encoding = encode_scientific_paper(
    dependencies=[alphafold_encoding, transformer_encoding, protein_db_encoding],
    research_domain="computational_biology",
    methodology="machine_learning",
    paper_type="empirical_study"
)

# Find methodologically similar papers
def find_methodologically_similar(target_encoding):
    return [paper for paper, enc in paper_database.items()
            if gcd(target_encoding, enc) > methodology_threshold]

# Machine learning papers across domains share arithmetic properties
ml_papers = [paper for paper, enc in paper_database.items()
            if enc % ML_METHOD_FACTOR == 0]
```

### Medical Knowledge Example

**Traditional Medical Protocol:**
```
Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes
Symptoms: [High blood glucose, Polyuria, Polydipsia]
Tests: [HbA1c > 6.5%, Fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL]
Treatment: [Metformin, Lifestyle modification]
```

**Arithmetic Encoding:**
```python
high_glucose_encoding = 4729183
polyuria_encoding = 8362947
hba1c_test_encoding = 9473628

diabetes_diagnosis_encoding = encode_medical_condition(
    symptoms=[high_glucose_encoding, polyuria_encoding],
    diagnostic_tests=[hba1c_test_encoding],
    medical_domain="endocrinology",
    severity_level=3
)

# Find conditions with similar symptom patterns
def find_differential_diagnoses(symptom_pattern_encoding):
    return [condition for condition, enc in medical_database.items()
            if gcd(symptom_pattern_encoding, enc) > symptom_threshold]

# Endocrine conditions share mathematical relationships
endocrine_conditions = [condition for condition, enc in medical_database.items()
                       if enc % ENDOCRINOLOGY_FACTOR == 0]
```

### Why This Works Beyond Mathematics

Every structured knowledge domain has:

1. **Hierarchical Dependencies**: Some knowledge builds on other knowledge
2. **Categorical Relationships**: Items belong to domains/types with shared properties
3. **Compositional Structure**: Complex items combine simpler components
4. **Logical Constraints**: Valid combinations follow rules

Mathematics just makes these relationships most explicit. But legal precedents, scientific theories, medical diagnoses, and business strategies all have the same underlying logical structure.

### The Key Insight: Structure Preservation

**Logical relationships become arithmetic relationships:**

- **Dependencies**: If knowledge item A depends on B, then `encoding(A)` is arithmetically related to `encoding(B)`
- **Similarity**: Items with similar foundations have encodings that share mathematical properties
- **Composition**: Combining knowledge items corresponds to arithmetic operations on their encodings
- **Discovery**: New insights emerge from arithmetic exploration of the encoding space

This transforms every knowledge domain into a space where AI can:
- **Discover** relationships through mathematical operations
- **Compose** knowledge through arithmetic
- **Reason** about complex scenarios through calculation
- **Generate** novel insights through encoding space exploration

The result is AI that thinks arithmetically about logical relationships across any structured domain—a fundamental shift from symbolic to mathematical reasoning.

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI systems process human-readable formats across every domain—a fundamental inefficiency. This project demonstrates that logical relationships can be preserved as arithmetic operations, enabling AI to reason through its computational strengths rather than emulating human cognition.

**Mathematical Theorem Proving** is our proof of concept because it has:
- Clear logical dependencies (theorem A depends on axioms B, C)
- Formal verification (we can check if our encoding preserves meaning)
- Existing libraries to test against (Lean, Coq, Isabelle)
- Measurable success criteria (proof finding, theorem synthesis)

But the **universal principle** applies wherever logical relationships exist: legal precedents, scientific citations, medical causation, engineering dependencies, business processes. Any domain with structured knowledge can benefit from arithmetic-native representations.

The breakthrough is not just faster theorem proving—it's a new paradigm for how AI systems process and reason about structured knowledge across all human domains.
