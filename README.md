# Bounded Gödel Encodings for LLM-Native Information Architecture

## Summary

**The Problem**: Current information systems are designed for humans—file hierarchies, URLs, text search, databases—forcing AI systems to process inefficient human-readable formats.

**The Solution**: Transform knowledge into arithmetic encodings that preserve logical relationships, allowing LLMs to reason through their native strength: mathematical operations rather than symbolic manipulation.

**Current Implementation**: A working system for mathematical theorem libraries (Lean, Coq, Isabelle) that encodes theorems as unique integers whilst preserving dependencies, enabling arithmetic-based reasoning and retrieval.

**The Vision**: This mathematical prototype demonstrates a universal principle applicable to any structured knowledge domain—legal precedents, scientific literature, medical diagnoses, engineering designs—where logical relationships can be preserved as arithmetic operations.

## Quick Start


### Basic Usage

#### 1. Parse Mathematical Libraries

```python
from mathematical_library_integration import LibraryIntegrationSystem

# Initialize the integration system
system = LibraryIntegrationSystem()

# Parse a Lean library
lean_theorems = system.integrate_library('lean', Path('/path/to/lean/library'))

# Parse multiple libraries
libraries = [
    {'type': 'lean', 'path': '/path/to/lean'},
    {'type': 'coq', 'path': '/path/to/coq'},
    {'type': 'isabelle', 'path': '/path/to/isabelle'}
]
all_theorems = system.integrate_multiple_libraries(libraries)

# Export unified format
system.export_unified_format(Path('unified_theorems.json'))
```

#### 2. Encode Theorems with Gödel Numbers

```python
from enhanced_bounded_godel_encoding import EnhancedGodelEncoder

# Initialize encoder
encoder = EnhancedGodelEncoder()

# Encode individual theorem
theorem_encoding = encoder.encode_theorem(theorem_object)

# Batch encode for performance
theorem_list = list(all_theorems.values())
encodings = encoder.encode_theorem_batch(theorem_list, parallel=True)

# Validate encoding quality
metrics = encoder.validate_encoding_quality()
print(f"Uniqueness: {metrics.encoding_uniqueness:.1%}")
print(f"Collision rate: {metrics.collision_rate:.1%}")
```

#### 3. Arithmetic-Based Reasoning

```python
# Find theorems by domain (using arithmetic divisibility)
algebra_factor = encoder.mathematical_domains['algebra']
algebra_theorems = [tid for tid, enc in encoder.theorem_encodings.items() 
                   if enc % algebra_factor == 0]

# Find complex theorems (high encodings indicate complexity)
import numpy as np
complex_threshold = np.percentile(list(encoder.theorem_encodings.values()), 80)
complex_theorems = [tid for tid, enc in encoder.theorem_encodings.items() 
                   if enc > complex_threshold]

# Find related theorems through mathematical operations
from math import gcd
def find_related_theorems(target_encoding, threshold=1000):
    return [tid for tid, enc in encoder.theorem_encodings.items()
            if gcd(target_encoding, enc) > threshold]
```

#### 4. Neural Architecture Training

```python
from neural_architecture_evolution import EvolutionaryGodelLLM, EvolutionConfig

# Configure architecture for mathematical reasoning
config = EvolutionConfig(
    d_model=768,
    num_domains=8,          # Mathematical domains
    num_libraries=3,        # Lean, Coq, Isabelle
    max_complexity=10
)

# Initialize model
model = EvolutionaryGodelLLM(config, vocab_size=50000)

# Train on mixed text + encoding data
# (Training loop implementation depends on your framework)
```

#### 5. Comprehensive Evaluation

```python
from evaluation import ComprehensiveEvaluator

# Run full evaluation suite
evaluator = ComprehensiveEvaluator(encoder, model, config)
metrics = evaluator.run_full_evaluation()

# Generate detailed report
report = evaluator.generate_evaluation_report(metrics)
print(f"Overall Score: {report['executive_summary']['overall_score']:.1%}")
print(f"Production Readiness: {report['executive_summary']['production_readiness']}")
```

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI systems process human-readable formats across every domain—a fundamental inefficiency. This project demonstrates that logical relationships can be preserved as arithmetic operations, enabling AI to reason through its computational strengths rather than emulating human cognition.

**Mathematical Theorem Proving** is our proof of concept because it has:
- Clear logical dependencies (theorem A depends on axioms B, C)
- Formal verification (we can check if our encoding preserves meaning)
- Existing libraries to test against (Lean, Coq, Isabelle)
- Measurable success criteria (proof finding, theorem synthesis)

But the **universal principle** applies wherever logical relationships exist: legal precedents, scientific citations, medical causation, engineering dependencies, business processes. Any domain with structured knowledge can benefit from arithmetic-native representations.

The breakthrough is not just faster theorem proving—it's a new paradigm for how AI systems process and reason about structured knowledge across all human domains.
